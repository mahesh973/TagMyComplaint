## Description

- Consumers can face challenges with financial products and services, leading to complaints that may not always be resolved directly with financial institutions. The **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)** acts as a mediator in these scenarios. However, consumers often struggle to categorize their complaints accurately, leading to inefficiencies in the resolution process.
  
- Our project aims to facilitate **faster complaint submission and resolution** by automatically categorizing complaints directly based on narrative descriptions, enhancing the efficiency of complaint management and smoothly routing it to the appropriate teams.
  
- We developed a **Hybrid** approach by leveraging language models (**BERT**) and traditional machine learning techniques to find a trade-off between computational complexity and the need for model re-training. We've fine-tuned [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased) using the Consumer Complaints data on the main [product](https://huggingface.co/Mahesh9/distil-bert-fintuned-product-cfpb-complaints) and [issue](https://huggingface.co/Mahesh9/distil-bert-fintuned-issues-cfpb-complaints) categories, and used supervised classifiers for categorizing sub-products and sub-issues.


## Impact

The implementation of our project has two primary impacts:

**Ease for Consumers:** Automates the tagging of complaints into appropriate categories, reducing the need for consumers to understand complex financial product categories.

**Industry Adoption:** Offers a streamlined approach to complaint handling that can be adopted by financial institutions beyond the CFPB, promoting consistency across the industry.
